I'm excited to share that I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Heltec V4 LoRa 32 Development Board, which I'll be setting up for Meshtastic projects. This device is the upgraded V4 version of the classic LoRa 32 board, featuring enhanced performance, and full compatibility with Meshtastic networks.

### Key Features

- **Upgraded ESP32-S3R2 & SX1262 LoRa:** Based on the latest ESP32-S3R2 chip with 2MB PSRAM and 16MB external Flash, supporting Wi-Fi b/g/n, BLE, and LoRa communication for superior processing in IoT and Meshtastic applications.
- **High-Power LoRa Transmission:** Available in high-power (28 ±1 dBm) and low-power (21 ±1 dBm) versions, with -137 dBm sensitivity for long-range communication in Meshtastic nodes and LoRa networks.
- **Integrated OLED Display & Protective Casing:** 0.96-inch OLED for real-time data visualization, PC casing for screen protection, and FPC 2.4G antenna for stable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.
- **Advanced Power Management:** Added SH1.25-2Pin solar panel interface (4.7~6V input), SH1.25-8Pin GNSS interface, optimized lithium battery management, and low power consumption (<20 μA sleep current) for outdoor deployments.
- **V3 Compatibility & Expanded Interfaces:** Retains form factor and pin layout of V3 (with gold-plated pins), supports Arduino and PlatformIO development, and includes Type-C USB, LoRa ANT (IPEX), and 2.4G ANT interfaces.

This board is ideal for Meshtastic nodes, smart agriculture, industrial IoT, wireless security systems, and more, with dimensions of 51.7 x 25.4 x 10.7 mm and operating temperature from -20 to 70°C.
