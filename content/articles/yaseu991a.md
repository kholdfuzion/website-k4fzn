The Shelby HamFest was an absolute blast! It was great meeting fellow hams and meshtastic users, checking out all the gear, and enjoying the vibrant community atmosphere. Thanks to everyone who said hello!

On top of that, my new Yaesu FT-991A just arrived! I'm excited to get it on the air. Currently, I'm working on designing a stealth antenna setup that the HOA won't notice. If you have any tips or experience with hidden antennas, I'd love to hear from you.
