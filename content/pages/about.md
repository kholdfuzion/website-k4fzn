title: About

A collection of tinkerings and ramblings from K4FZN.
<br><br>
As of July 15, 2025, I have obtained my General License! I have a 20+ year background in computers, electronics, and reverse engineering. My current hobby goal is to achieve a confirmed astronaut contact on the ISS using my homemade antenna based loosely on the Arrow design.
<br><br>
I am located in Waxhaw, NC, USA, where I live with my wife and two wonderful children.
